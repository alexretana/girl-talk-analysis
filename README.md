# girl-talk-analysis


Insirpation for this project: 
- [Adereth's Girl Talk Visualization](https://github.com/adereth/girltalk-visualization) and [his post](http://adereth.github.io/blog/2016/01/20/visualizing-girl-talk-with-clojure-and-d3-dot-js/) about it
- [CodingEntrepreneurs' Python API Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdq6Gz33khQ&t=1193s)


Update:

Spotify API class was built.

An attempt to parse the data file from Adereth's Git hub resulted turned out to be too complicated to parse easily. A better approach is to parse the live site's html.
